          <h1>NASA Robotic Mining Competition</h1>
          <p>
            This annual event brings more than 50 college teams, 500 students and
            their mining robots from across the country, including Alaska, Hawaii
            and Puerto Rico, to Kennedy Space Center. Since water ice is prevalent
            throughout the Red Planet, the Robotic Mining Competition has revised
            the rules and rubrics to reflect this discovery. The Competition
            challenge is to mine the precious icy regolith (gravel). This water
            ice will provide oxygen, water and fuel for future off-world
            colonists.        </p>
