          <h1>Carps on the Kitchen God day.</h1>
          <p>In Vietnamese tradition, kitchens are guarded by Kitchen Gods, who
          will look over the house for the owner. On December 23, it is believed
          that Kitchens Gods go up to the sky to present their end of year
          report to the God of the Sky. Interesting enough, riding on carps Is
          the only way for Kitchen Gods to go up to the sky. Therefore, it is no
          surprise to see carps somewhere in Vietnamese family on December
          23.</p>

          <h1>New Year Eve Party</h1>
          <p>Just like everywhere else in the world, Vietnam also celebrates the
          completion of the year on New Year Eve. This is a rare opportunity for
          family reunion. Family members, who live in different parts of the
          country, gather in the parents' house and shares their stories as they
          enjoy full-course dinner. After the dinner, everyone counts down for
          the new year celebration.</p>

          <p>It is customary to visit your neighbors during the first day of new
          year. However, some families are very selective about the first person
          of the year who enters their house, so be aware if you are planning to
          visit someone as their first guest. As a part of the holiday customs,
          you are expected to talk pleasantly, and swearing the strictly
          prohibited since it's a sign of bad luck. In return, you will be
          welcome with "Mut", dried fruits and nuts that are specially prepared
          for this occasion. Some of the common dried fruits often include
          coconut, pineapple, star fruit and watermelon seeds and candied
          ginger.</p>

          <h1>Sticky rice cakes on the 2nd</h1>
          <p>Banh Chung, Sticky rice cake, is a traditional Vietnamese rice
          cake. It is originated from the story of Lang Lieu, who was a prince
          of 16th Hung Dynasty. According to the stories, Lang Lieu created Banh
          Chung in a competition with his siblings for the successor of the
          king. Banh Chung comes in 2 forms: square form (Banh Chung) which
          symbolizes the Earth and round form (Banh Giay) which symbolizes the
          Sun.</p>

          <h1>Braised pork with eggs on the 3rd</h1>
          <p>Vietnamese typically don't cook during the first three days of the
          new year. Food for the entire holiday season has been prepared
          upfront. One of the common kinds is braised pork with eggs (or a big
          pot of braised pork with eggs) that feeds the Vietnamese family in the
          rest of the holiday season, from the 3rd to the 6th of January.</p>
