          <p>Tết ([tet˧˥] or [tɜːt˧˥]), or Vietnamese New Year, is the most
          important celebration in Vietnamese culture. The word is a shortened
          form of Tết Nguyên Đán, which is Sino-Vietnamese for "Feast of the First
          Morning of the First Day". Tết celebrates the arrival of spring based on
          the Vietnamese calendar, which usually has the date falling in January
          or February.[1]</p>

          <h1>New Year Eve Party</h1>
          <p>Just like everywhere in the world, Vietnamese also celebrates the
          completion of the year on New Year Eve. This is a rare opportunity for
          family reunion. Family members, who live in different parts of the
          country, gather in the parents' house and shares their stories as they
          enjoy full-course dinner.</p>

          planning to visit someone as their firs guest. As a part of holiday
          custom, you will be welcome with "Mut", dried fruits and nut. Some of
